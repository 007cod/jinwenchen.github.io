Iâ€™m a master's student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, supervised by Prof. Kai Zheng. Moreover, I am co-supervised by Dr. Yan Zhao. Previously, I received my B.E. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2024.

My research interests include spatio-temporal data and spatial crowdsourcing.
